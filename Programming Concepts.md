# Concept 1
In Python, functions only have pass by reference. Whereas C++ uses both pass by reference and pass by value for functions.

# Concept 2
Python is an interpreted programming language that uses a virtual machine to run. Whereas C++ is a langauge that uses a compiler so it does not run in a virtual machine.

# Concept 3
Python has an automatic garbage collection method that runs in the background. Whereas C++ does not have an automatic garbage collection method but one can and should be implemented into the program.
