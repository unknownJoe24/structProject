# Concept 1
In Python, functions only have pass by reference. Whereas C++ uses both pass by reference and pass by value for functions. The function in the Python version uses pass by reference whereas the C++ version uses pass by value.

# Concept 2
Python is an interpreted programming language that uses a virtual machine to run. Whereas C++ is a langauge that uses a compiler so it does not run in a virtual machine. 

# Concept 3
Python has an automatic garbage collection method that runs in the background. Whereas C++ does not have an automatic garbage collection method but one can and should be implemented into the program. The Python version has a garbage collector that is built into Python whereas the C++ version does not have a garbage collector implemented due to it being a simple program.
